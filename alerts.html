      <h2>Alerts</h2>
      <p>Alerts provide <strong>contextual feedback messages for typical user actions</strong>, as well as alerting them to important information they may need to know. Information and warning messages usually appear at the top of a page, under the Success
        and error messages might appear above a form. Use the appropriate color to match the purpose of your message. </p>
      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep alerts to 55-75 characters including spaces</li>
        <li>Use only one alert per page</li>
        <li>Alerts should have a time limit and be removed promptly</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example alerts</h3>

        hard to change, or has legal implications (for example, granting permissions for claims access).</p>
      <h3>More information on error messages</h3>
      <p>When users get an error message, they are probably feeling confused, stressed, frustrated, even angry.</p>
      <h4>Tips</h4>

        <li>Offer a solution or next step.</li>
        <li>Be straightforward. Explain what's going on right away.</li>
        <li>Be calm. Don’t use exclamation points or alarming words like “alert” or "immediately."</li>
        <li>Be serious. Don’t joke around with people who are frustrated.</li>
